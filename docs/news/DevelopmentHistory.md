# The Weird Development History Of ISys

The Development history of ISys was weird. It consisted of 3 OS changes, a bunch of testing, and a bunch of destruction.

## Beginning

ISys started on September 4th 2021 at 3:00PM.
It originally wasn't a GitHub project, originally just a git project.

ISys stands for "My System", or originally thought, "I System", and is a utility for building cross-platform build files with as little bugs as possible.

## Building the First version

The first version of ISys was published on september 5th, 2021.

The first version contained the `PRINT` function only.

This was when [States](../ref/State.md) were introduced.

## Rolling Release

ISys has a `Rolling Release` model, where there's constant changes and constant pushes with bug fixes, and some that occaisonally **cause** them.

## Installing & Updating

You can keep ISys up to date by running the `git pull` once in a while, it's always recommended to check the **CI**
to make sure the build is correct and there's no issues.

## What's happening now?

Now there's a lot more functions like `EXECUTE`, and Comments!

And there's macros like `#[include <file>]`
