# ISys Philosophies (Idea, Naming, Meaning)

## Idea

ISys originally started as a way for Me to begin building my own custom programming languages, It all started with
[PTEX](https://github.com/thekaigonzalez/PTEX), it is no longer maintained, but the syntax of ISys is heavily inspired off of it.

ISys did use some of PTEX's source code to help in the first stages, but then later moved on to it's own source and codebase.

## Naming

ISys means "I System", or if you want to put it; "My System",
It basically allows users to create build files to run projects and code in one command.

It serves as a compliment to `make`, which helps you develop your own build systems.

## Meaning

"My System", or ISys, is meant to be used as a build file system, with the option for standalone execution on the side.

More functions are coming out to make ISys less of a supportive language, and more of it's own language.
